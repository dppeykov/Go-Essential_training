# Go Essential training

## Notes

### Go installation

 - Needs git (for installing 3rd party packages) + go itself: https://golang.org/

### Go tools

 - go run welcome.go - will compile the program and run it
 - go build welcome.go - will create an executable with the name welcome
 - go help - for help
 - go test - for tests
 - go fmt - formats the code

### Go basics (see hello_world.go) 
### Types

All types: https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/3 (Book: https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro)

#### Numbers (see numbers.go)

 - We need to declare the type of the variables. 
 - In Go we have int (integer) that can be 8, 16, 32, 64 - check the link above for more info.
 - In case we are not declaring and assigning a variable at the same time, we need to declare the type first and then to assign a value. 
 - If no value is assigned to an integer, the default is 0.
 - Go is strongly typed, so we need to match the variables' type.
